## About The Project

![Screen Shot](imgs/screenshot.png)

This is a website made for the shop on 2b2t known as Fortune. As of right now, it's just a catalog-type site with info about the shop. But hopefully, soon payments will be processed through the site, and all transactions/listings will occur on the site!

## Built With

This site was built using the following languages:

* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
* [JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)

## Getting Started

It's really easy, all you do is click the green button that says "Clone", then click Download ZIP. After you download the zip, you'll wanna extract it to a folder, and once that's done you'll wanna open up the folder and double click on index.html. Once you've double-clicked on index.html, it should open the site up. (Of course, once it's hosted somewhere you won't wanna open it locally).

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/JakeJeeperjinks/fortuneshop/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
